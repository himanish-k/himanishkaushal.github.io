Hello, world!

This blog is part of an attempt at a lifestyle change, a change long-needed.

This blog will capture moments in my life through the lens of a wanna-be writer.
This blog will see tutorials, bug fixes, framework/programming language adoption, 
thought process while approaching a project, etc. This blog will see the 
Madridista and football enthusiast in me through rants and match analyses.

This blog will see a lot, and I hope in this process it witnesses my life turn sharp.
